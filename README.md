# routines_DTD
Routines used to make models of supernova rates as a function of
color with respect to a fitted red sequence. The models may then
be used to compute the likelihood of parametrized delay time
distributions (DTD) and to make figures containing the relevant
physical quantities.

QUICK START:
>>python setup.py build_ext --inplace

An example of SN Ia specific rates as a function of colors
can be generated by running:
..python ./src/example_call_ssnral.py

Figure 2 in the DTD paper (REF) may be reproduced by running:
>>python ./src/example_plot_rates_1.py

An auxiliar figure showing how specific rates change
according to choice of metallicity and onset time
can be obtained by running:
>>python ./src/example_plot_rates_1.py
