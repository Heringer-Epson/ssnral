# routines_DTD
Routines used to make models of supernova rates as a function of
color with respect to a fitted red sequence. The models may then
be used to compute the likelihood of parametrized delay time
distributions (DTD) and to make figures containing the relevant
physical quantities.

QUICK START:
>>python setup.py build_ext --inplace

An example of SN Ia specific rates as a function of colors
can be generated by running in the src/ directory:
python example_call_ssnral.py

Figure 2 in the DTD paper (H19) may be reproduced by running
in the src/ directory:
>>python example_plot_rates_1.py

An auxiliar figure showing how specific rates change
according to the choice of metallicity and onset time
can be obtained by running in the src/ directory:
>>python example_plot_rates_2.py

Input parameters, such as the IMF, meteallicity,
onset and cutoff times can be defined under:
input_pars.py

This package makes use of files produced with the
Flexible Stellar Population Synthetis (FSPS, v3.0), developed
and maintained by Charlie Conroy (see references below).
A python wrapper has also been used (Python-FSPS).

It is not necessary to install these packages for the
basic applications of this package because relevant FSPS
are made available under ./fsps_files. However, their
installation might be necessary if the user intends
to adopted FSPS runs with other set of parameters
than available. New FSPS files can be created following the
format for usage with this package by running in the src/ directory:

>>python make_default_FSPS.py.

However, in order to run this package, FSPS and Python-FSPS
need to be installed and their directories properly added
to the bash file (see original documentation for those
packages).
