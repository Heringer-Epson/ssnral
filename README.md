# routines_DTD
Routines used to make models of supernova rates as a function of
color with respect to a fitted red sequence. The models may then
be used to compute the likelihood of parametrized delay time
distributions (DTD) and to make figures containing the relevant
physical quantities.

QUICK START:
>>python setup.py build_ext --inplace

An example of SN Ia specific rates as a function of colors
can be generated by running:
>>python ./src/example_call_ssnral.py

Figure 2 in the DTD paper (H19) may be reproduced by running:
>>python ./src/example_plot_rates_1.py

An auxiliar figure showing how specific rates change
according to the choice of metallicity and onset time
can be obtained by running:
>>python ./src/example_plot_rates_1.py

This package makes use of files produced with the
Flexible Stellar Population Synthetis (FSPS), developed
and maintained by Charlie Conroy (see references below).
A python wrapper has also been used (Python-FSPS).
It is not necessary to install these packages for the
basic applications of tihs package. However, their
installation might be necessary if the user intends
to adopted FSPS runs with other set of parameters
than available under ./fsps_files
